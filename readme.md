# 761 Headless WordPress Theme

## Headless Theme for Fjord and Mach1

This repository hosts an empty WordPress theme designed for use with a Headless WordPress workflow. It's a joint venture by [Bridger Tower](https://bridger.to) and [Cameron Youngblood](https://cameronyoungblood.com) for [Alpine Codex](https://alpinecodex.com).

### Project Structure
- `functions.php`: Your functions file
- `index.php`: Main template file
- `style.css`: Main stylesheet
- `screenshot.png`: Theme screenshot

### Usage

> [How to Enable the WP Rest API]([url](https://www.perplexity.ai/page/Enable-the-WordPress-AnWC3ErbTzuT42iHORUI9g))

- Download the repository as a `.zip` file and upload it to your WordPress site as a theme. Activate the theme and you're ready to go!
- Install `Advanced Custom Fields` and enable the RestAPI for ACF. This will allow you to use ACF fields in your headless application.
- Use `functions.php` to create custom post types and taxonomies. You can also use this file to create custom endpoints for your headless application.
